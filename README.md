# Prediction of Process-Aware Enterprise Social Networks 
This repository is apart of the paper entitled "Prediction of Process-Aware Enterprise Social Networks and its Experiments Using Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Models".

Summary:
...In this study, we apply the long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict an enterprise social network that is formed through information regarding a systemâ€™s operation. More precisely, we apply the multivariate multi-step LSTM model to predict not only the next activity and next performer, but also all the variants of a process-aware enterprise social network based on the next performer predictions using a probability threshold. Furthermore, we conduct an experimental evaluation on the real-life event logs and compare our results with baseline research. The results indicate that our approach creates a useful model to predict an enterprise social network and provides metrics to improve the operation of an information system based on the predicted information.
